- UltraCam and NX Optimizer aim to bring true enjoyment out of your switch games, by improving the game's framerate logic and adding a very feature rich free camera.
- New **UltraCam** are being constantly developed by **MaxLastBreath** on [Kofi](https://www.nxoptimizer.com/ko-fi)/[Patreon](https://www.nxoptimizer.com/patreon), these mods are **EXTREMELY** complex and take a long time to develop, **new** Versions of existing mods such as **Tears Of The Kingdom** and **Breath Of The Wild** are being developed to support in-game menu and a lot more features.

  - Internal shadow resolution can now go up to 8K even with 1080p resolution
- FPS UltraCam (Dynamic FPS)
